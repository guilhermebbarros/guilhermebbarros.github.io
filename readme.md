# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my page! My name is Guilherme Barros. I am a physics major from the University of São Paulo and master in theoretical physics from the Institute of Theoretical Physics of the São Paulo State University. I am currently trying to migrate from physics to data science - and that is why I created this portfolio. 

# Projects 

I will insert here a brief description of my projects. For now, I only have the one project shown below, but I am working on more! 

**ENEM - How socioeconomic factors are tied to the final score** - In this project, I used data provided by the Brazilian government with the aim of analyzing how the scores of the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese) are related to the socioeconomic conditions of the students.
